This repository documents my end-to-end transition from data analyst to actuary.
It includes actuarial projects, modelling tools, exam preparation notes, and reproducible code in Python, R, and Excel.

📘 What’s inside

Actuarial Exam Notes (CS1, CM1, etc.)
Structured summaries, derivations, practice questions, and formula sheets.

Pricing Projects

Deterministic life insurance pricing model

Sensitivity analysis (mortality, expenses, discount rates)

Cashflow projections in Excel + Python

Reserving Projects

Claims triangle analysis

Chain-Ladder & Bornhuetter–Ferguson (R / Python)

Stochastic bootstrap reserving

Statistical Modelling

GLM pricing (frequency/severity + pure premium)

Validation metrics (AIC, Gini, Lift, RMSE)

Feature engineering for insurance datasets

Automation Tools

ETL pipelines (SQL → Python → reporting)

Automated reserving report generator

Reproducible notebooks & templates

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages: Python, R, SQL, VBA

Tools: Excel, Power BI, Jupyter, Git

Actuarial modelling concepts: pricing, reserving, GLMs, cashflow modelling

🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as a transparent, long-term portfolio demonstrating:

Actuarial technical skills

Statistical modelling capability

Clear documentation & communication

Consistent professional development

The link between mathematical theory and real actuarial applications

📌 Goals

Build a complete actuarial learning and project archive

Showcase progress publicly as I prepare for IFoA exams

Provide hiring managers a clear view of my modelling ability

Create production-ready actuarial modelling examples
