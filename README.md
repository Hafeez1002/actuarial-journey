This repository documents my complete, end-to-end journey toward becoming an actuary. It contains structured learning plans, projects, revision notes, and weekly progress updates designed to demonstrate clear development across technical, analytical, and actuarial domains.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

A public record of my actuarial development.

Evidence of consistent skill-building across analytics, modelling, and actuarial science.

A portfolio demonstrating readiness for actuarial analyst roles.

A hub for projects, notes, and study materials aligned with the IFoA exam pathway.
